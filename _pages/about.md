Hi, there! My name is Xiran. Welcome to my website. I would like to share some of my intresteing projects and little things about data analytics with you. 

I just graduated from M.S. in Statsitics program at [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/) in May, 2020 and I gained my B.S. in Statistics from the same school in May, 2018. Yasss, _GAMECOCKS_ fowever!! 

I am enthusiastic about analyzing data and telling stories behind numbers. Statistical modeling and programming are my favorite part in data analysis process. Especially, I am specialized at regression analysis and classification problems.
 
In my leisure time, I like wroking out and spending time outdoors to enjoy eveything about the nature. I love different cultures and I want to travel around the world to see, to feel and to undersatnd them.
